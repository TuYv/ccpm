# Impeccable

Designs and reviews production-grade frontend interfaces with strong UX, visual hierarchy, accessibility, responsive behavior, and anti-slop discipline.

This is the clean Companion edition derived from `pbakaus/impeccable` under Apache-2.0. It keeps the design reasoning and review logic, but intentionally excludes the upstream CLI, hooks, live browser mode, install flow, site, extension, marketing material, and bundled scripts.

## Protected Invariants

- Agent-only skill: do not require `npx`, bundled scripts, hooks, live mode, browser injection, extension APIs, or a product website.
- No commercial calls to action, install prompts, update checks, telemetry, or external service dependency.
- Keep `SKILL.md` compact and load detailed reference files only when relevant.
- Respect the host agent's higher-priority rules. When used from another review skill, that owner skill's safety rules win.
- For code-review use, stay read-only unless the user explicitly asked for implementation.

## Setup

Before design or review work:

1. Gather project context from existing files when present: `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `README`, design-system docs, tokens, CSS/theme files, component libraries, and representative pages/components.
2. Classify the surface:
   - `brand`: marketing, landing, campaign, portfolio, long-form content, or any surface where design is the product. Read `reference/brand.md`.
   - `product`: app UI, admin, dashboard, settings, tools, authenticated surfaces, or any surface where design serves the task. Read `reference/product.md`.
3. Read at least one concrete implementation file before making design claims. Prefer tokens, CSS, theme config, a shared component, and the changed or requested surface.
4. Pick only the reference files needed for the task.

If `PRODUCT.md` is missing, do not stop. Infer from available context, state the assumption, and continue. If `DESIGN.md` is missing, use visible conventions in code as the design source of truth.

## Shared Design Laws

### Color

- Use OKLCH when creating new color systems.
- Verify contrast: body text needs WCAG AA contrast, and muted text must still remain readable.
- Gray text on colored backgrounds often looks washed out. Use a darker shade of the background hue or transparent ink.
- Choose a color strategy before choosing colors:
  - Restrained: tinted neutrals plus one accent, best for most product UI.
  - Committed: one saturated color carries a large part of the surface.
  - Full palette: three or four roles used deliberately.
  - Drenched: the surface is the color, reserved for strong brand moments.
- Avoid category reflexes. If the palette can be guessed from the category alone, redesign the color direction.

### Typography

- Cap body line length around 65-75ch.
- Use real hierarchy through scale and weight. Avoid flat type systems.
- Keep display heading letter spacing readable. Do not let letters touch.
- For product UI, prefer fixed rem scales over viewport-fluid headings.
- For brand UI, choose fonts from brand voice, not from generic "modern" or "premium" reflexes.

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Identical padding everywhere looks mechanical.
- Cards are not the default layout. Use them only when they are the right affordance.
- Never nest cards inside cards.
- Use stable responsive constraints for fixed-format UI: aspect ratios, min/max widths, grid tracks, and container-aware sizing.
- Check text overflow on mobile and tablet.

### Motion

- Motion must explain state, continuity, hierarchy, or delight.
- Do not animate layout properties casually.
- Use ease-out quart/quint/expo curves. Avoid bounce and elastic for product UI.
- Provide reduced-motion alternatives.
- Content must be visible without waiting for animation triggers.

### Interaction

- Interactive elements need default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, and success states when applicable.
- Never remove focus outlines without a visible replacement.
- Prefer native affordances for dialogs, popovers, buttons, inputs, labels, and forms.
- Validate forms at humane moments, usually blur or submit, not every keystroke unless the feedback is genuinely useful.

### Absolute Bans

Refuse and redesign these patterns:

- Side-stripe borders as decoration on cards, lists, callouts, or alerts.
- Gradient text used as decoration.
- Decorative glassmorphism by default.
- The hero-metric template: big number, label, stats, gradient accent.
- Identical icon-card grids repeated as the main structure.
- Tiny uppercase eyebrow labels above every section.
- Numbered section markers unless the content is truly sequential.
- Text overflowing its container.
- Generic AI-looking palettes, excessive rounded cards, ghost-card border plus soft shadow, decorative stripe backgrounds, and sketchy SVG fallback illustrations.

## Command Routing

Use these routes when the user names a mode or when intent clearly matches one:

| Intent | Read |
| --- | --- |
| plan a feature before code | `reference/shape.md` |
| review UX and visual quality | `reference/audit.md`, `reference/brand.md` or `reference/product.md` |
| final quality pass | `reference/polish.md` when present, otherwise `reference/audit.md` and focused refs |
| production readiness | `reference/harden.md` |
| performance | `reference/optimize.md` |
| responsive behavior | `reference/adapt.md` |
| typography | `reference/typeset.md` |
| layout and spacing | `reference/layout.md` |
| color and contrast | `reference/colorize.md` |
| UX copy | `reference/clarify.md` |
| motion | `reference/animate.md` |
| forms and states | `reference/interaction-design.md` |
| make bland design stronger | `reference/bolder.md`, `reference/delight.md`, or `reference/overdrive.md` |
| make loud design quieter | `reference/quieter.md` or `reference/distill.md` |
| onboarding and empty states | `reference/onboard.md` |

For general frontend design work, read the matching register reference plus the two or three most relevant focused references.

## Review Output

When reviewing, lead with actionable findings. For each issue include:

- severity: P0/P1/P2/P3
- location: file, component, route, or visible surface
- impact: what user or system outcome suffers
- evidence: code line, visual state, accessibility rule, responsive condition, or design-system mismatch
- fix direction: concrete next step, not a broad rewrite unless genuinely necessary

Avoid subjective taste notes unless they connect to user comprehension, task success, accessibility, brand fit, maintainability, or conversion.

## Build Output

When implementing UI, produce real production code. Preserve the existing framework, component library, tokens, icon set, and routing conventions unless there is a concrete reason to change. Verify responsive behavior, focus states, loading/error/empty states, copy, and contrast before finishing.
