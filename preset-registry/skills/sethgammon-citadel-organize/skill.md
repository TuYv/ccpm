# /organize -- Project Organization Health

## Orientation

**Use when:** Auditing whether source files are in the right architectural layers, detecting loose files and misplaced assets, or configuring directory manifests and cleanup policies for a project.

**Don't use when:** You want a structural map of code relationships and module dependencies (use `/map`), you're moving logic between modules (use `/refactor`), or you need to execute a single organizational task without a health audit (use `/marshal`).

## Commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/organize` | Full flow: scan, detect, recommend, configure |
| `/organize --audit` | Check current files against the manifest, report violations |
| `/organize --cleanup` | Run dynamic directory cleanup based on TTL policy |
| `/organize --show` | Display current organization manifest |
| `/organize --unlock` | Set `locked: false` so enforcement is advisory |
| `/organize --lock` | Set `locked: true` so enforcement blocks violations |

## Protocol

### Step 1: CHECK -- Read Existing Configuration

1. Read `.claude/harness.json` and check for an `organization` key
2. **If `organization` exists and user ran bare `/organize`:**
   - Display current convention, root count, placement rule count, dynamic dir count
   - Ask: "Your organization manifest is already configured. Want to **audit** current
     compliance, **adjust** the rules, or **reconfigure** from scratch?"
   - Route based on answer: audit -> Step 6, adjust -> Step 4, reconfigure -> Step 2
3. **If `organization` exists and user ran `--audit`:** Jump to Step 6
4. **If `organization` exists and user ran `--cleanup`:** Jump to Step 7
5. **If no `organization` key:** Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: SCAN -- Three-Pass Project Analysis

Every scan runs all three passes. A user running `/organize` gets the full picture.

**Do NOT use `find` or `Get-ChildItem`** -- use the **Glob tool** and **Bash** (`git ls-files`, `du`, `wc`) for cross-platform compatibility.

---

#### Pass 1: Architectural Compliance

1. Use the **Glob tool** with pattern `**/` to discover directories. Filter out:
   `node_modules`, `.git`, `.planning`, `.citadel`, `.claude`, `dist`, `build`,
   `__pycache__`, `.next`, `target`, `.venv`, `venv`.
   Cap at 200 directories. If too large, scan only top 3 levels.
2. Read `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, or equivalent for stack
3. Read harness.json for `language` and `framework` fields
4. Count files per directory to find the "heavy" areas
5. Check for existing convention signals:
   - `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/utils/` -> **layer-based**
   - `src/features/auth/`, `src/features/dashboard/` -> **feature-based**
   - `src/auth/components/`, `src/auth/hooks/` -> **hybrid**
   - Flat `src/` with no subdirectories -> **flat**
   - Mixed signals -> **custom** (needs user input)
6. If an organization manifest exists, check each placement rule against current files. Count compliant vs. violating files.

Record findings:
```
Detected: {convention}
Confidence: {high|medium|low}
Roots: [{path, purpose, file_count}]
Signals: [{pattern, evidence, convention_match}]
Anomalies: [{path, issue}]
```

**Scoring:** `architecture_score = compliant_files / total_source_files * 100`.
If no manifest exists, score is based on how consistently the detected convention is followed.

---

#### Pass 2: Filesystem Hygiene

1. **Loose files in project root.** List every file in the project root. Expected root files:
   - Config: `package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `*.config.{js,ts,mjs,cjs}`, `.eslintrc*`,
     `.prettierrc*`, `babel.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `vite.config.*`, `next.config.*`,
     `rollup.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`,
     `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `.env*`, `.editorconfig`,
     `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.npmrc`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.tool-versions`
   - Docs: `README*`, `LICENSE*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `CLAUDE.md`,
     `QUICKSTART*`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT*`, `SECURITY*`
   - CI/lock: `*.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`,
     `Gemfile.lock`, `.github/`, `.husky/`
   - Plugin/harness: `.claude/`, `.planning/`, `.citadel/`, `hooks/`, `hooks_src/`,
     `skills/`, `agents/`, `scripts/`
   - Any file listed in `.gitignore`

   Everything else in root (images, PDFs, ZIPs, random scripts, stray source files) is a finding.

2. **Images and assets outside designated directories.** Glob for
   `**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg,ico,webp,mp4,mp3,wav,pdf}`. Check if they
   live under a recognized asset directory (`assets/`, `public/`, `static/`,
   `images/`, `img/`, `media/`, `docs/images/`, `src/assets/`). Files outside are findings.

3. **Large files (>1 MB).** Use `git ls-files -z | xargs -0 stat` or equivalent
   to find tracked files over 1 MB. Report each with path and size.

4. **Empty directories.** Glob for directories, check which contain zero files
   (excluding `.gitkeep`). Report as clutter.

5. **Stale files in active directories.** Files in `src/` not modified in 6+ months
   while siblings are active. Report as "potentially stale" -- advisory only.

6. **Duplicate filenames.** Scan for files with identical names in different directories.
   Flag for awareness.

**Scoring:** Start at 100, deduct:
- -2 per loose non-standard file in project root
- -1 per misplaced asset file
- -3 per large file (>1 MB) tracked in git
- -1 per empty directory
- -0.5 per potentially stale file (capped at -10)
- -0.5 per duplicate filename (capped at -5)

Floor at 0. `hygiene_score = max(0, 100 - deductions)`.

---

#### Pass 3: Bloat Detection

1. **Project size vs. source size.**
   - Total tracked size: `git ls-files -z | xargs -0 stat` (sum sizes)
   - Source code size: same but filtered to `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.rs`,
     `.go`, `.java`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.html`, `.md`
   - Ratio: `source_bytes / total_bytes`. Healthy = >60%. Below 40% means non-source dominates.

2. **Largest files ranked.** List top 10 largest tracked files with sizes.

3. **Binary files in git.** Glob for:
   `*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,ico,webp,mp4,mp3,wav,woff,woff2,ttf,eot,zip,tar,gz,jar,dll,so,dylib,exe,bin,dat,db,sqlite,pdf}`.
   Check if each could be gitignored or moved to Git LFS. Report count and total size.

4. **Accidentally committed directories.** Check if any of these exist as tracked paths:
   `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `target/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`,
   `venv/`, `.cache/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/`, `coverage/`. Any hit is a critical finding.

5. **Compressible assets.** PNGs over 500 KB, SVGs over 100 KB, any video/audio file.

**Scoring:** Start at 100, deduct:
- If source ratio <60%: -(60 - ratio)
- -5 per accidentally committed build/dependency directory
- -2 per binary file in git that should be gitignored or in LFS
- -1 per compressible asset (PNG >500KB, SVG >100KB)
- -3 per video/audio file tracked in git

Floor at 0. `bloat_score = max(0, 100 - deductions)`.

---

#### Composite Score

```
composite_score = round(
  architecture_score * 0.40 +
  hygiene_score * 0.35 +
  bloat_score * 0.25
)
```

**Always report all four numbers.** Never report just the architecture score.

```
=== Project Health: {project_name} ===

Architecture:  {score}%  -- source file placement, layer boundaries, test colocation
Hygiene:       {score}%  -- loose files, misplaced assets, stale artifacts, empty dirs
Bloat:         {score}%  -- project size ratio, binaries in git, compressible assets
-------------------------------
Overall:       {composite}%
```

Follow scores with the most actionable findings from each pass. Group by severity (critical first, advisory last). Cap at 10 findings per pass; note "and N more" if truncated.

### Step 3: RECOMMEND -- Present Options

Present a tailored recommendation based on confidence level:

**If confidence is HIGH:** Present the detected convention and its roots. Ask: [Accept], [Adjust], or [Show alternatives].

**If confidence is MEDIUM:** Present the detected convention with anomaly count and 2-3 alternatives including reorganization cost (number of files to move). Ask: [1/2/3].

**If confidence is LOW:** Present the four convention options (feature-based, layer-based, hybrid, flat) with a one-line best-for description each, plus [Custom]. Ask: [1/2/3/4/5].

Wait for user response before proceeding.

### Step 4: CONFIGURE -- Write the Organization Manifest

**4a. Build the roots tree:**

For each detected root directory:
```json
{
  "purpose": "short description of what belongs here",
  "children": { ... }  // recursive, only if subdirectories have distinct purposes
}
```
Only go 2-3 levels deep.

**4b. Build placement rules:**

Derive placement rules from the detected convention:

| Convention | Example Rules |
|---|---|
| Feature-based | `*.test.ts` -> colocated with source, `*.types.ts` -> colocated |
| Layer-based | `*.test.ts` -> `__tests__/` or `tests/`, `*.types.ts` -> `types/` |
| Hybrid | `*.test.ts` -> colocated within feature, `*.types.ts` -> `{feature}/types/` |
| Flat | No placement rules |

For each rule:
```json
{
  "glob": "*.test.{ts,tsx}",
  "rule": "colocated",
  "target": null,
  "reason": "Tests live next to the code they test"
}
```

Rule types:
- `colocated` -- file must be in the same directory as its source
- `sibling-dir` -- file must be in `target` directory adjacent to source
- `root-dir` -- file must be under `target` from project root
- `within-root` -- file must be under one of the declared roots

Ask the user if they want to adjust any rules before writing.

**4c. Build dynamic directory entries:**

Scan for directories created dynamically by the harness or tools. For each:
```json
{ "path": ".planning/screenshots/", "scope": "session", "cleanup": "empty-on-expire" }
```

Scopes: `session` | `campaign` | `task` | `permanent`

Cleanup strategies: `empty-on-expire` | `archive-then-delete` | `delete` | `ignore`

**4d. Set cleanup policy:**

Ask the user:
```
When dynamic directories expire, how should cleanup work?
1. Auto -- Clean up silently on session end
2. Prompt -- Show what would be cleaned and ask first
3. Manual -- Just report stale directories, don't touch them
[1/2/3] (default: 2)
```

**4e. Write to harness.json:**

Read-modify-write. Merge the `organization` key. Do NOT overwrite other keys.

```json
{
  "organization": {
    "convention": "layer",
    "roots": { ... },
    "placement": [ ... ],
    "dynamic": [ ... ],
    "cleanupPolicy": "prompt",
    "locked": false
  }
}
```

Set `locked: false` initially. Tell the user they can run `/organize --lock` once confident.

### Step 5: VERIFY -- Confirm the Manifest Works

1. Run a full three-pass audit (Step 6 logic) against the current codebase
2. Report all three scores plus composite
3. If composite < 60%: warn with top issues
4. If architecture > 80% but hygiene or bloat < 60%: call out the drag and note quick wins
5. Tell the user about `--lock`, `--audit`, and `--cleanup` commands

### Step 6: AUDIT -- Full Three-Pass Health Check

Run all three passes from Step 2. Output the composite score block first:

```
=== Project Health: {project_name} ===

Architecture:  {score}%
Hygiene:       {score}%
Bloat:         {score}%
-------------------------------
Overall:       {composite}%

--- Architecture ({N} violations) ---
  {glob pattern} should be {rule}:
    - {violating_path} -> {expected_path}

--- Hygiene ({N} findings) ---
  Loose files in project root:
    - {filename}
  Images outside asset directories:
    - {path} -> should be {target}
  Large files (>1 MB):
    - {path} ({size})
  Empty directories:
    - {path}

--- Bloat ({N} findings) ---
  Source ratio: {ratio}% ({source_size} source / {total_size} total)
  Top 5 largest files:
    1. {path}  ({size})
  Binary files that could be gitignored:
    - {path} (generated/build output)

--- Suggested Actions ---
  [Concrete fixes, quick wins first, larger reorganizations last]

Run quick fixes (move misplaced files, delete empty dirs)? [y/n]
```

If the user says yes, execute safe fixes (moves, empty dir removal).
Never auto-delete files with content -- only move them or flag for manual review.

### Step 7: CLEANUP -- Prune Dynamic Directories

Read the `dynamic` entries from the organization manifest.

For each entry:
1. Check if the directory exists
2. Determine if expired based on scope:
   - `session`: check `.planning/telemetry/` for last session end timestamp. Files older than last session start are stale.
   - `campaign`: check `.planning/campaigns/` for associated campaign status. If `completed` or `parked`, contents are stale.
   - `task`: check if the task ID still exists.
   - `permanent`: skip
3. Apply the cleanup strategy for expired entries:
   - `empty-on-expire`: delete contents, keep directory
   - `archive-then-delete`: move to `.planning/archive/{YYYY-MM-DD}/`, then empty
   - `delete`: remove directory and contents (recreate if in PLANNING_DIRS)
   - `ignore`: report but don't touch

**Respect cleanupPolicy:** `auto` executes silently; `prompt` asks before each category; `manual` lists stale dirs without modifying.

Output:
```
=== Cleanup Report ===
Scanned: {N} dynamic directories
Stale: {M} directories ({total_size})

  {path} ({scope}-scoped, {N} files, {size})
    Strategy: {strategy}
    Action: {Cleaned | Would clean | Skipped}

Summary: {N} directories cleaned, {M} archived, {K} skipped
```

## Fringe Cases

- **`.planning/` does not exist:** Run `/do setup` first to initialize the harness state directory; then re-run.
- **No directories found:** Skip scan, suggest flat convention.
- **Monorepo detected** (multiple package.json): Scan each package root separately. Ask if organization should be per-package or repo-wide.
- **User changes convention:** Warn about number of files to move. Do NOT auto-move without explicit confirmation.
- **Conflict with existing rules:** If harness.json `protectedFiles` conflict with placement rules, warn and ask which takes precedence.
- **Dynamic dir doesn't exist yet:** Keep the entry in the manifest. Don't warn about missing dynamic dirs.
- **Archive directory grows large:** If `.planning/archive/` exceeds 50MB, warn and suggest manual pruning.

## Contextual Gates

**Disclosure:** "Running project health scan. Phase 3 (cleanup) may move files — will confirm scope before executing."
**Reversibility:** amber — may move files or rename directories in cleanup phase; undo with `git checkout -- .` or `git revert`
**Trust gates:**
- Any: run scan and view report (Phases 1-2)
- Familiar (5+ sessions): Phase 3 file moves execute autonomously; novices should stop after Phase 2 (report only)

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All three passes ran -- never skip a pass
- [ ] All three scores plus composite reported
- [ ] Project directory tree scanned (Step 2 completed or skipped with existing config)
- [ ] User presented with options and made a choice (not auto-decided)
- [ ] Organization manifest written to harness.json under `organization` key
- [ ] Placement rules are specific (glob + rule + reason, no vague entries)
- [ ] Dynamic directory entries have valid scope and cleanup strategy
- [ ] User told about `--lock`, `--audit`, and `--cleanup` commands
- [ ] No other harness.json keys modified during write

## Exit Protocol

```
---HANDOFF---
- Health: {composite}% (Architecture {arch}%, Hygiene {hyg}%, Bloat {bloat}%)
- Convention: {convention} applied to {project}
- {N} roots, {M} placement rules, {K} dynamic directories configured
- Top findings: {1-2 most impactful issues from hygiene/bloat passes}
- Enforcement: {"advisory (unlocked)" | "blocking (locked)"}
- Reversibility: amber — file moves undoable with `git checkout -- .`; harness.json changes undoable with `git revert`
- Next: Run `/organize --lock` when confident, `/organize --audit` to recheck
