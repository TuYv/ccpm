  A packaged Stata Runner skill via official MCP-for-Stata server including stata_do, ado_package_install, help, read_log and get_data_info tools. Use it when (1) need to execute Stata do-file; (2) missing ado-packages; (3) find code error caused by syntax in Stata; (4) want to read smcl and text format log file with rich text output; (5) first encounter a data file and want to understand its structure and content.

# MCP-for-Stata
> Official plugin for MCP-for-Stata maintained in collaboration with [SepineTam](https://github.com/sepinetam).

[MCP-for-Stata](https://statamcp.com) is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Stata's statistical and econometric capabilities to LLMs. This toolset supports executing do-files, querying data file structures, installing ado packages, reading Stata logs, and looking up command documentation. 

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the MCP-for-Stata server to be installed and running. If you have not configured it yet, follow `@references/installation.md`. After installation, verify with `uvx stata-mcp doctor`. Restart your AI client after installation (required for the first-time setup).

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user mentions any of the following scenarios:

- Needs to execute a Stata do-file for regression or statistical analysis
- Encounters a Stata syntax error and needs to troubleshoot or verify command usage
- Needs to install third-party ado packages (e.g., outreg2, reghdfe, estout)
- First encounters a data file and wants to quickly understand its variable structure and distribution
- Needs to read a Stata execution log (.log or .smcl)
- Needs to look up the official documentation and syntax for a Stata command

## Workflow

### 1. First Encounter with Data → `get_data_info`

When the user provides a data file path (.dta, .csv, .xlsx, .sav) or says "look at this data," call `get_data_info` first.

**Key points:**
- `data_path`: absolute path to the data file
- `vars_list`: if the user only cares about specific variables, pass a list of variable names; otherwise omit (defaults to all)
- `head`: defaults to 0 (no preview rows). Only set to a positive integer when the user explicitly asks to see rows

**Return value includes:** data source, number of observations, variable list, variable types, and descriptive statistics (mean, standard error, min, max) for each variable.

**Note:** results are cached based on MD5 hash of file content. Repeated queries on the same file hit the cache.

---

### 2. Execute Stata Code → `stata_do`

When the user asks to run Stata commands, perform regression analysis, generate graphs, process data, etc., call `stata_do`.

**Pre-requisites:**
1. Write Stata code into a `.do` file (using the Write tool)
2. Confirm the file path is within an allowed directory (`<WORKING_DIR>/.statamcp/stata-mcp-dofile/` or `<WORKING_DIR>`)
3. Call `stata_do(dofile_path=..., log_file_name=...)`

**Key parameters:**
- `dofile_path`: absolute path to the do-file
- `log_file_name`: custom log filename without timestamp, optional
- `read_log_when_error`: defaults to false. When true, only returns log content when Stata returns an error code (e.g., r(198))
- `enable_smcl`: defaults to true, also generates .smcl log (Unix only)

**Return value:** `log_file_path` (text and smcl paths); may contain `log_content` on error.

**Notes:**
- Security guard is enabled by default and blocks dangerous commands (shell, erase, rm, !, etc.)
- Do-file must be within a whitelisted directory; otherwise execution is rejected
- SMCL log preserves hyperlinks from commands like findsj and getiref (Unix only)

---

### 3. Install Third-Party Packages → `ado_package_install`

When the user mentions a Stata command does not exist or needs to install packages like outreg2, reghdfe, estout, etc., call `ado_package_install`.

**Key parameters:**
- `package`: package name. For GitHub source, use "user/repo" format
- `source`: "ssc" (default), "github", or "net"
- `is_replace`: defaults to true, forces reinstallation
- `package_source_from`: required only when source="net", specifies directory or URL

**Examples:**
- `ado_package_install("outreg2")` — install from SSC
- `ado_package_install("SepineTam/TexIV", source="github")` — install from GitHub

**Note:** SSC installations can be slow. If the package may already be installed, ask the user whether to skip.

---

### 4. Look Up Command Documentation → `help`

When the user asks about the syntax, options, or usage of a Stata command, or wants to verify a command before troubleshooting an error, call `help`.

**Key parameter:**
- `cmd`: Stata command name (e.g., "regress", "describe", "xtset")

**Return value:** Stata help text string. If cache is hit, prefix shows "Cached result for {cmd}: ..."

**Notes:**
- **Unix only** (macOS/Linux), not available on Windows
- Caching is enabled by default (in-memory + disk at `~/.statamcp/help/`)
- If cached content seems incorrect, set `STATA_MCP__CACHE_HELP=false` to force a refresh

---

### 5. Read Execution Log → `read_log`

When the user asks to view a Stata execution log, analyze output results, or wants to inspect the full log after `stata_do` execution, call `read_log`.

**Key parameters:**
- `file_path`: absolute path to the log file
- `output_format`: "dict" (recommended, structured command-result pairs), "full" (all original content), "core" (removes framework lines)
- `is_beta`: defaults to false. When true, uses structured parsing (Unix only, recommended for .smcl + dict format)
- `lines`: content truncation. 0 returns all; positive returns first N items; negative returns last |N| items

**Notes:**
- File must be within the `stata-mcp-folder` directory (security boundary)
- Beta mode uses the StataLog parser and may contain parsing errors

---

### 6. Write Do-File (Deprecated)

`write_dofile` is marked as deprecated. Modern AI agents have native file-writing capabilities. Use the Write tool to create do-files instead of calling this MCP tool.

This tool is disabled by default and only available when `STATA_MCP__ENABLE_WRITE_DOFILE=true`. It will be removed in a future version.

---

## Typical Workflow

### Scenario A: Full Data Analysis Pipeline

1. `get_data_info` — explore data structure
2. Write do-file based on data characteristics (Write tool)
3. `ado_package_install` — install third-party packages if needed
4. `stata_do` — execute the do-file
5. `read_log` — inspect execution results if needed

### Scenario B: Troubleshooting Syntax Errors

1. `help` — look up official command documentation (Unix only)
2. Fix the code in the do-file
3. `stata_do` — re-execute to verify

### Scenario C: Install and Use a New Package

1. `ado_package_install("pkg_name")` — install
2. `help pkg_name` — check package usage
3. Use the package commands in the do-file
4. `stata_do` — execute

## Edge Cases

- **help Unix limitation**: not available on Windows; guide users to alternative documentation methods
- **write_dofile deprecated**: do not use this tool to write do-files; use the Write tool instead
- **security guard enabled by default**: dangerous commands (shell, erase, rm, !) in do-files are blocked. To disable, set `STATA_MCP__IS_GUARD=false` (not recommended)
- **RAM monitoring disabled by default**: to monitor Stata process memory, set `STATA_MCP__IS_MONITOR=true` and `STATA_MCP__RAM_LIMIT`
- **path boundary check**: do-files and log files must be within whitelisted directories; otherwise execution is rejected
- **SSC installation slow**: `ado_package_install` from SSC source may take time; skip if the package is already installed
