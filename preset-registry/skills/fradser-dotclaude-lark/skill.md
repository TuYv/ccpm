# Lark CLI Skills

**CRITICAL** -- Before any lark-cli operation, MUST first read [`lark-shared/SKILL.md`](lark-shared/SKILL.md) for authentication, identity, permissions, and security rules.

This skill is a router for all Lark/Feishu CLI operations. Based on user intent, read the corresponding sub-skill SKILL.md before executing.

## Routing Rules

1. Always read `lark-shared/SKILL.md` first for auth context
2. Identify the target sub-skill from the index above
3. Read the sub-skill's `SKILL.md` for detailed instructions and shortcuts
4. Sub-skill references/ directories contain per-command details -- read as needed
5. For whiteboard content in documents, coordinate between `lark-doc` and `lark-whiteboard` (the former `lark-whiteboard-cli` is now merged into `lark-whiteboard`)
