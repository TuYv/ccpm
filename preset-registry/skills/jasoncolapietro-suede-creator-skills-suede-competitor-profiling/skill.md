# Suede Competitor Profiling

Use this Suede competitive-intelligence playbook to turn current public evidence into structured profiles with fact, inference, and unknowns kept separate.

## Initial Assessment

Check for `.agents/product-marketing.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md`) and read it if present — your own positioning and ICP decide which competitors are actually comparable and which dimensions are worth profiling, and they are usually already written down there.

Then work the intake list under Task-Specific Questions below. If the user gave URLs and the context file covers the rest, proceed without asking.

---

## Saving Raw Data

Before synthesizing the profile, persist all raw page captures, SEO inputs, and
review evidence to disk so they can be re-read, audited, or reused without
repeating provider requests or manual collection.

**Directory layout** (relative to project root):

```
competitor-profiles/
├── raw/
│   └── <competitor-slug>/
│       └── <YYYY-MM-DD>/
│           ├── scrapes/    # one .md file per captured page (homepage.md, pricing.md, ...)
│           ├── seo/        # one .json or .csv file per authorized metric source
│           └── reviews/    # one .md or .json file per review source (g2.md, capterra.md, ...)
├── <competitor-slug>.md    # final synthesized profile
└── _summary.md             # cross-competitor summary
```

Rules:

- `<competitor-slug>` is lowercase, hyphenated (e.g. `responsehub`, `safe-base`)
- `<YYYY-MM-DD>` is the date the data was pulled — supports re-running and diffing snapshots over time
- Save each browser, manual, or authorized-fetch page capture as raw markdown
  to `scrapes/<page-name>.md`
- Save each authorized SEO response or user-supplied export to
  `seo/<source-name>.<json|csv>`
- Save each review source to `reviews/<source>.md` (cleaned text) or `.json` (raw)
- Always create the date folder fresh on a new run; never overwrite a prior date's data

The synthesized profile (`<competitor-slug>.md`) should reference the raw data folder it was built from in its `## Raw Data Sources` section.

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Public-Site Evidence

For each competitor URL, capture key public pages to extract positioning,
features, pricing, and messaging.

**Availability gate:** Inspect the tools currently exposed in the session
before selecting an acquisition method. A named connector is usable only when
it is actually available, connected to the intended account when applicable,
authorized for this task, and its current schema has been read. Do not invent a
tool call from the examples below.

If no mapping or page-fetch tool is available, use a browser-neutral/manual
fallback: open the public site, follow its primary navigation, inspect its
public sitemap or search results when accessible, record the exact URLs and
access date, and capture only evidence visible to the user. Respect access
controls, site terms, robots directives where applicable, and rate limits.

**When the gate blocks you** — a source needs an account you were not given, a
platform is not connected, a site's terms or robots directives put a page out of
bounds, or the user wants a dossier published or sent onward without having
authorized it — halt in four parts:

1. Stop. Do not collect the blocked source or publish the dossier.
2. Name the blocker in one line ("G2 reviews for <competitor> require a signed-in
   account; this session has no authorized G2 connection").
3. Offer 2-4 options (proceed without that source and mark the fields
   `not collected`; the user supplies an export; the user authorizes the
   connection; substitute a permitted source).
4. Wait for the answer. Do not pick one and continue.

#### Step 1: Map the site

If a current authorized connector exposes a site-map or crawl capability, use
its documented schema to discover the site structure. For example, some
Firecrawl connections expose a `firecrawl_map` operation, but that name is not
guaranteed. Otherwise build the URL list through the manual fallback.

```
available map capability or manual navigation → verified competitor URLs
```

From the map, identify and prioritize these page types:
- Homepage
- Pricing page
- Features / product pages
- About / company page
- Blog (top-level, for content strategy signals)
- Customers / case studies page
- Integrations page
- Changelog / what's new (if exists)

#### Step 2: Capture key pages

If a current authorized connector exposes single-page fetch or extraction, use
its documented schema on each identified URL. For example, some Firecrawl
connections expose `firecrawl_scrape`. Otherwise open each public page and
capture the relevant visible text manually.

```
available page-fetch capability or browser/manual capture → page evidence
```

Save each result to `competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/scrapes/<page-name>.md` before extracting fields.

Extract from each page:

| Page | What to Extract |
|------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | Headline, subheadline, value proposition, primary CTA, social proof claims, target audience signals |
| **Pricing** | Tiers, prices, feature breakdown per tier, billing options, free tier/trial details, enterprise pricing signals |
| **Features** | Feature categories, key capabilities, how they describe each feature, screenshots/demo signals |
| **About** | Founding story, team size, funding, mission statement, headquarters |
| **Customers** | Named customers, logos, industries served, case study themes |
| **Integrations** | Integration count, key integrations, categories |
| **Changelog** | Release velocity, recent focus areas, product direction signals |

#### Step 3: Capture competitor reviews (optional but high-value)

If a connected search/fetch tool is available and authorized, use its current
schema to find the sources below. Otherwise search or browse them manually.
Platform-specific or account-only content may be accessed only when that
platform is actually connected and the user has authorized it.
- G2 reviews page for the competitor
- Capterra reviews page
- Product Hunt launch page
- TrustRadius profile

Save each scraped review page to `competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/reviews/<source>.md`. Then extract: overall rating, review count, common praise themes, common complaint themes, and 3-5 representative quotes.

---

### Phase 2: Optional SEO and Market Data

First inspect current available tools and user-provided files. If an authorized
SEO-data connector is exposed, read its current schemas and gather the same
metrics for every competitor. Some DataForSEO connections use the capability
names below, but their presence and exact schemas are not guaranteed. If no
provider is available, analyze a current user-supplied export or mark these
fields `not collected`; never substitute guessed values.

Save each raw response or export to
`competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/seo/` before parsing.
Record provider, access date, market, device, database, and that traffic,
authority, and value metrics are provider estimates. See
[references/tool-reference.md](references/tool-reference.md) for conditional
capability mapping and manual fallbacks.

#### Domain Authority & Backlinks

When the connected provider exposes an equivalent of `backlinks_summary`,
collect:
- Domain rank / authority score
- Total backlinks
- Referring domains count
- Spam score

When it exposes an equivalent of `backlinks_referring_domains`, collect:
- Top referring domains (quality signals)
- Link acquisition patterns

#### Keyword & Traffic Intelligence

When it exposes ranked-keyword data, collect:
- Total organic keywords ranking
- Keywords in top 3, top 10, top 100
- Estimated organic traffic

When it exposes a domain organic overview, collect:
- Domain-level organic metrics
- Estimated traffic value
- Top keywords by traffic

When it exposes site-keyword discovery, collect:
- What keywords they target
- Content gaps vs. your site

#### Competitive Positioning Data

When it exposes organic-competitor overlap, collect:
- Their closest organic competitors (may reveal competitors you haven't considered)
- Market overlap data

When it exposes relevant-page estimates, collect:
- Their highest-traffic pages
- Content that drives the most organic value

---

### Phase 3: Synthesis

Combine scraped content with SEO data to build the profile. Cross-reference claims (e.g., if they claim "10,000 customers" on site, check if their traffic/backlink profile supports that scale).

### Phase 4: Prove it before you hand it over

Run this before the profile leaves your hands. It is one `ls` against a
structure Phase 1 and Phase 2 already produced:

```
ls -R competitor-profiles/raw/<competitor-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/
```

- Every field not marked `[unknown]` and not marked `not collected` traces to a
  saved file in that folder. A `[fact: ...]` field traces to the `scrapes/`,
  `reviews/` or `seo/` file it was read from; an `[inference]` field traces to
  the scrape file it was inferred from, not to a separate artifact.
- Any field that traces to nothing gets re-collected or re-marked `[unknown]`.
  It is never softened into confident prose — that is exactly what Boundaries
  forbids below.
- The `## Raw Data Sources` block names the date folder the profile was built
  from, so the same check is repeatable by someone else later.

---

## Output Format

### Profile Document Structure

Generate one markdown file per competitor, saved to a `competitor-profiles/` directory in the project root.

**Filename**: `competitor-profiles/[competitor-name].md`

**Read [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) before writing the first
profile of a run**: it holds the evidence-marker legend that every field uses, the
full Deep Profile Template, the Quick Scan Template, and the summary, positioning-map,
SWOT and changelog templates. Do not reconstruct a profile structure from memory —
consistency across profiles is what makes them comparable.

The deep profile runs these sections in order: At a Glance, Positioning & Messaging,
Product & Features, Pricing, Customers & Social Proof, SEO & Content Strategy,
Strengths & Weaknesses, Competitive Implications, Raw Data Sources.

---

### Summary Document

After profiling all competitors, generate a `competitor-profiles/_summary.md` that includes:

1. **Competitor landscape overview** — one paragraph summarizing the competitive field
2. **Comparison table** — key metrics side by side for all profiled competitors
3. **Positioning map** — where each competitor sits (e.g., simple↔complex, cheap↔premium)
4. **Key takeaways** — 3-5 strategic observations from the research
5. **Gaps and opportunities** — where the market is underserved

---

## Quick Scan vs. Deep Profile

### Quick Scan (faster, lower cost)
- Public-site evidence: homepage + pricing page only
- SEO: one consistent provider overview and ranked-keyword summary when an
  authorized source or user export is available; otherwise `not collected`
- Skip: reviews, technology stack, backlink details
- Output: abbreviated profile (At a Glance + Positioning + Pricing + SEO summary)

### Deep Profile (comprehensive)
- Public-site evidence: all key pages + available review sources
- SEO: full backlink analysis + keyword intelligence + competitor discovery
- Include: technology stack, content strategy analysis, review mining
- Output: full profile template

Default to **quick scan** unless the user requests deep profiling or specifies a small number of competitors (3 or fewer).

---

## Handling Multiple Competitors

When profiling more than one competitor:

1. **Parallelize only when supported** — capture independent homepages or
   pricing pages concurrently only when the available tool supports it and its
   quota allows it; otherwise work sequentially
2. **Use consistent metrics** — use the same available provider, market,
   device, database, date window, and metric definitions for every competitor;
   otherwise mark the comparison unavailable
3. **Build the summary last** — after all individual profiles are complete
4. **Prioritize by relevance** — if the user has 10+ competitors, suggest profiling the top 5 first based on domain overlap or market similarity

---

## Updating Profiles

Profiles are snapshots. When updating:

- Check pricing pages first (most volatile)
- Refresh SEO metrics only through the same available provider and matching
  market/device/database parameters, or mark them unavailable
- Scan changelog for product changes
- Update the "Generated" date
- Note what changed since last profile in a `## Change Log` section at the bottom

---

## Task-Specific Questions

Only ask if not answered by context or input:

1. What competitor URLs should I profile?
2. Quick scan or deep profile?
3. Any specific dimensions to focus on (pricing, SEO, positioning)?
4. Should I compare findings against your product?

---

## Boundaries

- Do not present inference, stale pricing, traffic estimates, review summaries, or feature availability as verified current fact.
- Do not access private accounts, bypass controls, scrape prohibited sources, contact competitors, or publish a dossier without authorization.
- Do not label a competitor weak, deceptive, or noncompliant without a stated comparison criterion and evidence.
- Do not decide product, pricing, legal, or sales strategy; surface supported implications and unresolved questions.

## Routing

- Need a public comparison or alternative page -> use `suede-competitors`.
- Need a sales battle card -> use `suede-sales-enablement`.
- Need review and forum synthesis -> use `suede-customer-research`.
- Need pricing, ad, or content implications -> use `suede-pricing`, `suede-ads`, or `suede-content-strategy`.
- From those skills, route current-source competitor research back to `suede-competitor-profiling`.
