> **仅限显式调用**：此技能仅应在用户使用 `/launch-checklist` 显式请求时运行。不要根据上下文匹配自动调用。

## 阶段 1：解析参数

读取发布日期参数或 `dry-run` 模式。试运行模式会生成检查清单，但不会创建签署条目或写入文件。

---

## 阶段 2：收集项目上下文

- 读取 `CLAUDE.md`，了解技术栈、目标平台和团队结构
- 读取 `production/milestones/` 中最新的里程碑
- 读取 `production/releases/` 中任何现有的发布检查清单
- 如果存在，读取 `design/live-ops/content-calendar.md` 中的内容日历

---

## 阶段 3：扫描代码库健康状况

- 统计 `TODO`、`FIXME`、`HACK` 注释的数量及其位置
- 检查生产代码中是否遗留任何 `console.log`、`print()` 或调试输出
- 检查占位资源（搜索 `placeholder`、`temp_`、`WIP_`）
- 检查硬编码的测试/开发值（localhost、测试凭据、调试标志）

---

## 阶段 4：生成发布检查清单

## 阶段 5：保存检查清单

向用户展示已完成的检查清单和摘要（条目总数、阻塞项数量、条件项数量，以及存在未完成部分的部门）。

如果不是试运行模式，请询问：“可以将其写入 `production/releases/launch-checklist-[date].md` 吗？”

如果用户同意，则写入该文件，并根据需要创建目录。

---

## 阶段 6：后续步骤

- 在发布前运行 `/gate-check`，以获得正式的 PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL 结论。
- 通过 `/team-release` 协调签署确认。
