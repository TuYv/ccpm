# /do setup — First-Run Experience

Configures the harness for a specific project: installs hooks, detects stack, writes harness.json, and optionally demos the system on real code. Flag: `/do setup --express` skips mode selection and runs Express directly.

## Orientation

**Use when:** first-run configuration of Citadel on a new project -- installs hooks, generates harness.json, scaffolds .planning/.
**Don't use when:** harness is already configured and you want to verify it (use /verify); adding a single skill to an existing project (copy SKILL.md manually).

## Protocol

### Step -1: ARCHIVE DETECTION (all modes, before anything else)

```bash
ls docs/citadel/ 2>/dev/null
```

If `docs/citadel/` exists and contains `.md` files with `citadel-archive: true` in frontmatter, extract `exported-at` date and prompt once:

```
Found a Citadel archive from {exported-at date}.
  Campaigns: {N}  Postmortems: {N}  Backlog items: {N}  Research: {N}

Restore history into .planning/ during setup? [Y/n]
```

- **Y or Enter**: set `restoreArchive = true`. Restore after Step 1 (see ARCHIVE RESTORE below).
- **n**: skip silently.

If no archive found, skip entirely — no output.

**ARCHIVE RESTORE** (runs after Step 1 if `restoreArchive = true`):

| File | Restore to |
|---|---|
| `campaigns.md` | Split sections → `.planning/campaigns/completed/{name}.md` |
| `postmortems.md` | Split sections → `.planning/postmortems/{name}.md` |
| `research.md` | Split sections → `.planning/research/{name}.md` |
| `backlog.md` | Split sections → `.planning/intake/{name}.md` |
| `discoveries.md` | Split sections → `.planning/discoveries/{name}.md` |
| `project.md` | Strip frontmatter → `.citadel/project.md` |
| `harness.json.md` | Strip frontmatter → `.claude/harness.json` |

Splitting: each `## Section Title` becomes one restored file. Strip frontmatter before writing.

After restore: `  ✓ Archive restored — {N} campaigns, {N} postmortems, {N} backlog items`

---

### Step 0: MODE SELECTION

```
Welcome to Citadel.

How would you like to get started?

  [1] Recommended  — auto-detect your stack, install hooks, live demo  (~3 min)
  [2] Full Tour    — everything in Recommended + guided skill walkthrough (~8 min)
  [3] Express      — zero questions, auto-detect, hooks installed, done  (~30 sec)

Press Enter for Recommended, or type 1, 2, or 3.
```

If harness.json already exists with full config, add:
```
  [4] Update — reconfigure existing setup (current: {language}, {skillCount} skills)
```

Default: Recommended. If `--express` flag passed: skip mode selection, run Express.

---

### Step 1: INSTALL HOOKS (all modes, always first)

Hooks must be live before anything else.

```bash
node {citadel-root}/scripts/install-hooks.js
```

Find `{citadel-root}`:
1. Read `.citadel/plugin-root.txt`
2. Fallback: directory containing this SKILL.md

The installer reads `hooks/hooks-template.json`, resolves absolute paths, writes into `.claude/settings.json`, preserves non-Citadel settings, is idempotent.

**On success:** `  ✓ {N} hooks installed (protect-files, external-gate, circuit-breaker, quality-gate + more)`

**On failure:** output the error, explain manual install path (`node /path/to/Citadel/scripts/install-hooks.js`), continue — setup must not abort.

---

### Step 2: STACK DETECTION (all modes)

Auto-detect by scanning the project root. Never ask what can be read.

**Language detection (check in order):**
| File | Language |
|---|---|
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript |
| `package.json` (no tsconfig) | JavaScript |
| `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | Python |
| `go.mod` | Go |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java |

**Framework detection (read package.json dependencies):**
| Dependency | Framework |
|---|---|
| `next` | Next.js |
| `react` (no next) | React |
| `vue` | Vue |
| `svelte` | Svelte |
| `@angular/core` | Angular |
| `express` | Express |
| `fastify` | Fastify |

**Package manager:**
| File | Manager |
|---|---|
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm |
| `yarn.lock` | yarn |
| `bun.lockb` | bun |
| `package-lock.json` | npm |
| `requirements.txt` | pip |
| `Pipfile` | pipenv |

**Test framework:** read `package.json` devDependencies for `jest`, `vitest`, `mocha`, `jasmine`. Python: check `pytest` in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml.

**Typecheck config by language:**
| Language | Command | Per-file |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` | yes |
| Python + mypy | `mypy {file}` | yes |
| Python + pyright | `pyright {file}` | yes |
| Go | `go vet ./...` | no |
| Rust | `cargo check` | no |
| JavaScript | (none) | no |

**Confirmation (Recommended + Full Tour only):**
Output: `Detected: {language}{+ framework if any} · {packageManager} · {testFramework if any}`
Then: `Correct? [y/n/edit]`
- `y`/Enter: proceed; `n`/`edit`: ask for corrections inline
- Express: skip confirmation, use detected values

---

### Step 3: GENERATE CONFIG (all modes)

Write `.claude/harness.json` using Node (not Write tool — harness.json is protected after first install):

```javascript
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const existing = fs.existsSync('.claude/harness.json')
  ? JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('.claude/harness.json', 'utf8'))
  : {};

const skillDirs = fs.readdirSync('{citadelRoot}/skills', { withFileTypes: true })
  .filter(d => d.isDirectory()).map(d => d.name);

const config = {
  language: '{detected}',
  framework: '{detected or null}',
  packageManager: '{detected}',
  typecheck: { command: '{command}', perFile: {bool} },
  test: { command: '{testCommand}', framework: '{testFramework}' },
  qualityRules: { builtIn: ['no-confirm-alert', 'no-transition-all'], custom: [] },
  protectedFiles: ['.claude/harness.json', '.claude/settings.json'],
  features: { intakeScanner: true, telemetry: true },
  registeredSkills: skillDirs,
  registeredSkillCount: skillDirs.length,
  agentTimeouts: { skill: 600000, research: 900000, build: 1800000 },
  trust: {
    sessionCount: existing.trust?.sessionCount || 0,
    campaignCount: existing.trust?.campaignCount || 0,
    level: existing.trust?.level || 'novice'
  },
  ...existing  // preserve consent, storage, policy
};
fs.writeFileSync('.claude/harness.json', JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));
"
```

**Skill registry rebuild:** populate `registeredSkills` from every directory under `{citadelRoot}/skills/` plus `.claude/skills/`. Set `registeredSkillCount` to match.

**Dependency pattern suggestions (Recommended + Full Tour only):**
Read `package.json` and check for known libraries:

| If installed | Suggest warning | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `@tanstack/react-query` | raw `fetch(` / `axios` | Use tanstack query instead of raw fetch |
| `zustand` | `React.createContext` | Use Zustand instead of React Context |
| `date-fns` | `new Date().toLocaleDateString` | Use date-fns for date formatting |
| `zod` | `typeof ` / `instanceof ` | Use Zod for runtime validation |

For each match: `"I see {package} installed. Warn agents when they use {anti-pattern}? [y/n]"`
Add accepted patterns to `dependencyPatterns` in harness.json.

---

### Step 4: CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md (all modes)

```bash
node {citadelRoot}/scripts/bootstrap-project-guidance.js --project-root {projectRoot}
```
Creates `.citadel/project.md` and generates `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`. Safe to run — only creates files that don't exist.

**Project description (Recommended + Full Tour only):**
Ask: `"What's this project? One line is fine — or press Enter to use the package name."`
Skip if CLAUDE.md already exists with content.

**CLAUDE.md merge rules:**
- Does not exist → generate starter with detected stack + description
- Exists, no `## Citadel Harness` section → append that section at bottom only
- Exists with `## Citadel Harness` → skip, don't duplicate
- NEVER overwrite or delete existing content

Starter template:
```markdown
# {Project Name}

{Description}

## Stack
- Language: {detected}
- Framework: {detected}
- Package manager: {detected}
- Test framework: {detected}

## Conventions
(Add your coding conventions, architecture rules, and patterns here.)

## Architecture
(Describe your directory structure and layer boundaries here.)

## Citadel Harness

This project uses the [Citadel](https://github.com/SethGammon/Citadel) agent
orchestration harness. Configuration is in `.claude/harness.json`.
```

---

### Step 5: OPTIONAL INTEGRATIONS (Recommended + Full Tour only)

Present as one prompt:

```
Optional integrations — choose any, or press Enter to skip all:

  [g] GitHub    — scaffold Claude triage workflow for issues + PRs
  [m] MCP       — create .mcp.json with common servers pre-configured
  [b] Both
  [s] Skip

```

**GitHub integration:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/` if missing
2. Copy `.planning/_templates/claude-triage.yml` → `.github/workflows/claude-triage.yml` (skip if exists)
3. Copy `.planning/_templates/REVIEW.md` → `REVIEW.md` (skip if exists)
4. Output: `"Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to Settings > Secrets > Actions to activate."`

**MCP integration:**
1. Copy `.planning/_templates/.mcp.json` → `.mcp.json` (skip if exists)
2. Output: `"Edit .mcp.json to uncomment the servers you want."`

---

### Step 6: LIVE DEMO (Recommended + Full Tour only)

**Find target file:** `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD 2>/dev/null | head -5`, filter for source files. Use most recently changed. If no git history, use `find` for recently modified files.

**Pain point question:**
```
What's your biggest frustration with AI coding tools right now?

  [a] Repetitive context — I keep re-explaining my codebase
  [b] Quality — the agent breaks things or misses issues
  [c] Context loss — every new session starts from zero
  [d] Scale — fine for small tasks, falls apart on big ones
  [e] Something else / skip demo

```

**Demo by pain point:**

| Pain point | Demo | Script |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Repetitive context | Run `/review` on target file | "This review uses the harness.json config you just set up — it already knows your stack, conventions, and quality rules." |
| (b) Quality | Run `/review` on target file | "The quality-gate hook just ran on every edit made during setup. Here's what that looks like on your code:" |
| (c) Context loss | Show `.planning/` structure, explain campaigns | "Sessions now persist. Start a campaign today, close your laptop, resume tomorrow." |
| (d) Scale | Run `/review` on largest source file | "For bigger work: `/marshal` for multi-step sessions, `/archon` for multi-day campaigns, `/fleet` for parallel agents." |
| (e) / skip | Skip demo | Continue to reference card |

Execute on real code. Show output.

---

### Step 7: FULL TOUR WALKTHROUGH (Full Tour only)

**Family 1: Code Quality (2 min)**
```
/review [file]         — 5-pass review: correctness, security, perf, readability, consistency
/test-gen [file]       — generate tests matched to your test framework
/systematic-debugging  — 4-phase root cause: observe → hypothesize → verify → fix
```
Show: run `/review` on the file from Step 6 if not already done.

**Family 2: Building (2 min)**
```
/scaffold [thing]      — generate new files matching project conventions
/refactor [scope]      — safe multi-file refactoring with rollback checkpoints
/create-skill          — capture a repeated pattern as a reusable skill
```

**Family 3: Research (1 min)**
```
/research [question]   — structured investigation with confidence levels
/research-fleet        — parallel scouts, multiple angles, synthesized findings
/infra-audit           — maps infrastructure from config files
```

**Family 4: Orchestration (1 min)**
```
/marshal [thing]       — multi-step, one session, costs ~$2-5
/archon [thing]        — multi-session campaign, survives context limits
/fleet [thing]         — parallel agents in isolated git worktrees
```

**Family 5: Observability (1 min)**
```
/dashboard             — live view of campaigns, costs, hooks value, queues
/cost                  — session and campaign cost breakdown from real token data
/learn                 — extract reusable patterns from a completed campaign
```

After walkthrough: `That's the system. Everything routes through /do — you never have to choose the right tool.`

### Step 8: REFERENCE CARD (all modes)

Print the reference card with actual counts from detected config.

```

**Express mode**: print abbreviated card (THE ONE COMMAND + WHAT'S NOW PROTECTING only).

---

### Step 9: CLOSING LINE (all modes)

**Express:**
```
Done. {N} hooks live, {N} skills registered.
Type /do [anything] to start.
```

**Recommended:**
```
Setup complete. Citadel is configured for {language}{+ framework}.
{N} hooks are protecting this session. {N} skills are registered.
Type /do [anything] to get started — or /do --list to browse all skills.
```

**Full Tour:**
```
Tour complete. You've seen the full system.
{N} hooks live · {N} skills registered · trust level: {level}

The best next thing: /do "review the most important file in this codebase"
```

**Update:**
```
Configuration updated. {N} hooks reinstalled, {N} skills re-registered.
Changes: {list what changed vs previous config}
```

---

## Fringe Cases

**Plugin not found (`.citadel/plugin-root.txt` missing):** Prompt for Citadel install path. Write answer to `.citadel/plugin-root.txt`.

**Project has no source files:** Skip demo. Output: `"Once you have code, try /review [file] to see the harness in action."`

**harness.json is protected and Write tool is blocked:** Use `node -e "..."` via Bash — Node script bypasses the Write hook, which is correct since setup is the authorized path.

**Existing CLAUDE.md with no blank line at end:** Append newline before `## Citadel Harness` section.

**Stack detection fails entirely:** Fall back to: `"What's your primary language? (typescript / javascript / python / go / rust / other)"`

**Re-running setup on configured project (Update mode):** Show diff of what would change. Don't silently overwrite. Confirm each change.

**`bootstrap-project-guidance.js` not found:** Skip silently — fall back to manual CLAUDE.md template.

---

## Contextual Gates

**Disclosure:** "Configuring Citadel for this project. Will modify `.claude/settings.json` and install hooks."
**Reversibility:** amber — writes `.claude/settings.json`, installs hooks, creates `.planning/`; undo by running `/unharness`
**Trust gates:**
- Any: first-run configuration; expected to modify settings and install hooks

## Quality Gates

- Hooks must be installed before any other step completes
- harness.json must contain `registeredSkillCount` matching actual skill count
- CLAUDE.md must not lose existing content
- Demo must run on real user code, not a canned example
- Reference card must show accurate skill and hook counts
- Closing line must confirm hooks are live

## Exit Protocol

Do not output a HANDOFF block. Setup is the beginning.
After the closing line, wait for the user's next command.
